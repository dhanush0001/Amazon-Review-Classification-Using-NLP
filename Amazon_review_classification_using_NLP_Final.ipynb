If you cheating on your customers #Mamaearth trust me on this you can't fool people more than once. Now I know that your Brand is not good enough. I am not going to buy any product from your Brand again.Thumbs down for mamaearth onion oil !!\n",
      " Used This Mama Earth Newly Launched Onion Oil twice, and i must say im already impressed by the results !It prevents hair loss, helps control premature greying, dryness, dandruff, scalp eruptions and many other hair problems after its regular use !To avoid dry and frizzy hair, make sure that you use this oil to your hairs twice a week.Oiling provides your scalp with essential nutrients, and also strengthens the hair roots. Mamaearth onion oil works best for your hair during all the seasons.\n",

      " I have been trying different onion oil for my hair as my hair is not very healthy. This product has literally changed the texture of my scalp and I am really happy with the results. It comes in a nice colorful packaging too. Definitely recommend this one to everyone looking out for onion oil.  For more reviews you can follow me on Instagram @insi_lovemyself.\n",
      " I have been using this product for some time now. My Roommate had this and I had been planning to order for a while now. I just used to forget all the time, finally I have it now.Well from the last 2 months of use, here's my experience with the product:I use it every night and get a shower in the morning.Pros:1. The oil is non greasy, and pretty light.2. Has very good smell.no pungent or awkward fragrance3. My hair doesn't lump in together as with other hair oil products.4.Gives a pretty good shine and dark color5. It's very helpful for dandruff, hairfall/ hairloss. I don't have a very dense hair presence so my scalp was visible all the time, Now it looks pretty dense.Cons.1 .can't find anything at allI do recommend it for people having hairfall issues.\n",
      " I purchased both oil and shampoo after watching fake YouTube  and customer review.After first day of use of oil and shampoo my hairfall increased.\n",
      " It's a very good product from mamaearth. The oil gives your hair full strength and perfect shine. Onion are rich in sulphur thats add up the strength of hair roots and holds the hair preventing hairloss. Suitable for all type hair. For better result use at night. Go for it.\n",
      " Why are you showing onion oil benefits in your ad , when you ate not giving onion oil in your product. I bought this for redensyl content ...but not sure about the percentage of it bein added. Secondly it only has onion extracts, which am sure not is effective.Switchin back to my conventional method of makin onion juice and applyin on scalp\n",
      " I used it only one time so I can't say about hairfall control but I couldn't stop myself to mention about its amazing effect. It made my hair extremely soft and shiny which was visible properly. Smell was strong but not bothering. I think this is the best hair fall which I have used till date. My search ends over here I suppose. Just waiting to see its impact on arresting hairfall.\n",
      " I bought this hair oil after viewing so many good comments. But this product is not good enough.First of all it's Expensive...Second thing the amount of the product is low (half bottle) YES!The bottle is not completely filled with oil. If you cheating on your customers #Mamaearth trust me on this you can't fool people more than once. Now I know that your Brand is not good enough. I am not going to buy any product from your Brand again.Thumbs down for mamaearth onion oil !!\n",
      " Used This Mama Earth Newly Launched Onion Oil twice, and i must say im already impressed by the results !It prevents hair loss, helps control premature greying, dryness, dandruff, scalp eruptions and many other hair problems after its regular use !To avoid dry and frizzy hair, make sure that you use this oil to your hairs twice a week.Oiling provides your scalp with essential nutrients, and also strengthens the hair roots. Mamaearth onion oil works best for your hair during all the seasons.\n",
      " So bad product...My hair falling increase too much..I order shampoo mask and oil.. nothing stop hairfallAfter 3 to 4 wash my hair falling so badly...\n",
      " Product just smells similar to navarathna hair oil .. but not strong as that and oil is not sticky after applying three drops of oil !!

      " Nice one... My 2.5 yr old son likes to brush with this flavour- strawberry. Previously I used to use Chicco but switched to this one due to good reviews and lower price.I had used Mee Mee also but this one's ingredients are better for my child's health.\n",
      " My 2 year old child doesn't have cavity but started developing bad breaths the morning after, while using this toothpaste for a couple of weeks during day and night brushing sessions. I feel this toothpaste might actually cause cavity rather than keep it away, from my experience. I immediately shifted back to Pigeon toothpaste for night brushing and the bad breath stopped from the next day onward.  I had purchased it for its all natural properties. Mama Earth team needs to research more on the ingredients on this product. I use other Mama Earth products and they are decent. Not this toothpaste though.\n",
      " Berry flavoured blast that the kids just love!  And the best part is that its perfectly fine if  they swallow it too! Made with 100% safe ingredients, this should be the toothpaste you should introduce your kids to! Mamaearth Berry Blast toothpaste is 100% safe and toxin free. My kids love the Berry taste while brushing. This is one of the best flouride free tooth pastes available for kids that you should be buying right away!\n",
      " Well how much a 12 month old with 4 almost 5 teeth brushes. But this product is good to start eating or tasting rather by baby. that way it is natural and taste good. i applied bit on her teeth thn forgot where i kept it.Buy for your own satisfaction if baby is really small and if understands how to brush and spit or eat than go for it.\n",
      " Pros:1. Natural strawberry flavour.2. SLS & Fluoride free toothpaste.3. 100% vegan.4. Claims to be plastic responsible.Cons:None that I found in the last few months.Verdict:Recommended toothpaste for kids above 1 year. My son likes it. The strawberry flavour is quite noticeable when you're brushing your kid. Wish if this was available as single pack instead of minimum qty as 2 since it takes quite a lot of time to finish the tube when you are taking only a peanut size or less portion for brushingIf you think my review was helpful, don't forget to click the helpful link below the review.\n",
      " Very good product. Reliable and very good quality. My child (4YO) loves it. Earlier he was using Chicco toothpaste. Now loving it. Mamaearth is at par with Chicco in quality yet way economical.\n",
      " I bought it for my 2 years baby. It's mentioned that even if the child gulps it, then also it won't be harmful. Although I am trying my best to teach my little one how to spit out while brushing.I am happy with the product.\n",
      " The important aspect i considered while placing the order was\"its safe, even if swallowed\".Small kids love to brush with it.Its the tooth paste with all safe ingredients.\n",
      " The taste is a bit like mild flavoured bubble gum.... My 2 yr old likes it. Plus it claims to be safe for kids since it is all natural without flouride and SLS (chemical used for foaming).Wish that the quantity was a bit more\n",
      " It is completely natural so I feel safe for my son. Before I used dento shine tooth paste. But this has changed a lott. Just go for it . It safe.\n",

      " I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says it's a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.\n",
      " It's thick.It has beads and I don't know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesn't foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale.  Still isn't worth it )I don't think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.It's disappointing !!!!\n",
      " So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more. The consistency of this facewash is bit thick like a scrub making it unusual for others but I loved it as it makes your skin clean and radiant. Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation.\n",

      " Had tried this product majorly because of the name and ingredients that it has. For the first time a company is able to get the product that is based on our ancient secret recipes of our Dadi Nani... a person like me who has super dry skin, this is the perfect product for me as it hydrates my skin thoroughly and gives an instant freshness like the way ubtan gives. Very good for my super dry & super sensitive skin. Loved this product. Kudos mamaearth for this amazing thought behind this product .\n",
      " After reading so many great reviews, was eagerly waiting for this face wash but when I opened it the tube was half empty...very disappointed.\n",

      " Ubtan Facewash- made from Turmeric and Liqurice Extract. Was excited to use as heard first time about facewash of Ubtan. Helps in removing dead cells and gives a glow on skin. Very helpful product to repair sun damage and tan and to protect your skin from tanning.\n",
      " Horrible product...i have normal skin which tends to dry in winters...i ordered it in march when i enjoy healthier skin...but i was in search of herbal product and decided to order this...and i regret...my skin has rashes and that happens only after 3daz of use....i could infer that the rashes were becoz of this facewash as all other skincare products were same....for all who are reading this review...plz dont waste ur money....and get trapped by the marketing gimmick\n",
      " Mamaearth ubTAN Natural Face Wash is one the best product of Mama Earthand it  Suits to every  skin types, it  helps in removing  all signs of tan. Liquorice helps repair the sun damage caused by exposure to the harsh rays of the sun. Turmeric light the skin tone and  improves the skin complection.It's one of the best face wash. Smells also very nice.\n",
      " I bought this because I was super impressed with the ingredients list. This one says it's a skin-lighting face wash which I felt so disappointed about at first but then I realised it makes your skin lighter by removing tan from your face. I am really very impressed with the effects. It leaves my skin squeaky clean and makes it brighter. I really love the fragrance of this face wash.\n",
      " It's thick.It has beads and I don't know why they want me to scrub my face off everyday !!!It doesn't foam like a facewash.It smells like pulpy orange while applying and then smells a bit like turmeric after washing off.My face looked bright after using it but not as bright as my previous facewashes.Made my skin dry. It was annoying since my skin was already dry without it and it made it worse !It is definitely not worth the money ( I got it for 175rs in a sale.  Still isn't worth it )I don't think it worked on my tan. I still dont see any changes in skin.It's disappointing !!!!\n",
      " So this is one such facewash free from parabens and sulfate, hence made me order it. Talking about the natural ingredients like turmeric and liquorice extract attracted it more. The consistency of this facewash is bit thick like a scrub making it unusual for others but I loved it as it makes your skin clean and radiant. Best for people who wants to get rid of tanning, discoloration and pigmentation.\n",

      " Frankly I have ordered this product after seeing so many good reviews..and here is my honest review after using for about 15 days--Does not break my skin- feel light and mositurized- does nothing for my marks or uneven toneSo, the purpose of fading marks or making glowing skin is not at all entertained so far.Yet I want to wait till 1 bottle use. Can be used as light mositurising serum for upcoming summers. Hopes it helps!\n",
      " Mamaearth's face serum it's just very amazing. I have tried so many products for my face pigmentation problem but this product is superb. Due to this product my pigmentation problem is resolved plus my skin qulaity is improved. It comes with vitamin C which is very essential for healthy skin. So happy to come across this product , superb happy with my glowing skin. I sure trying this product one won't switch to another.\n",
      " Fast absorbing & non-greasy Face Serum, Turmeric properties works well for radiant skin and Vitamin C antioxidant properties supporting it very well with reducing acne/dark spots. Using it from the last 15 days and so far it's really working well for me, Can't say about actual result so soon need to wait at least 15-20 days more to check actual results on Face Brightens and Fine Lines Reduction.\n",
      " I ordered this serum on the recommendation of my very dear friend. The serum comes in a small pump type packaging. After a week of use i can tell that the procuct is effective. The serum keeps the skin hydrated and blooming. The serum provides radiance to the skin thus compatible with every skin tone. It doesnt make your face fairer but it definitely provides glow to the skin. The product is worth a try.\n",
      " Um the product is really not for people with sensitive skin. I read good reviews on Amazon and ordered it (I was using vitamin c products from other brands which are really expensive so I thought I could give this a try since this is very affordable). But within a week of use I started breaking out all over my face, the big zits kind. I had to stop using within a week of its use. May be the product works for non-sensitive skin, product is really light, can’t tell if it gives any kind of moisture to the skin. I had to change my entire skin care routine, bought my tried and tested organic products and my skin is much much better. I don’t trust mamaearth any more.\n",
      " It may not suit everyone may be. I had high expectations from this..my skin isn't acne prone and I had smooth skin before I used it. I just started using it just for the sake of extra glow but it turned out opposite for me. I used it 3 days n now stopped as I got small white acne on forehead n on nose u can check the picture. N what I'm worried about it I got a small white patch under my eyes the 3rd day. M horrified n won't use it and don't recommend this to everyone. I wasted my 500 bucks!!\n",
      " I was really hoping that this serum will be as good as the mcaffeine face serum.....But after using 1whole bottle of it.....I really can't see any visible changes on my skin.....It didn't reduced my pigmentation....And it is really very liquidy in consistency that it dries out my skin.....I have to apply a moisturizer after using this serum. Well it didn't worked for me at all.....Wasted 😢\n",
      " Waste of money. Do not buy . No results.\n",
      " Just go for it. Before I started using it I had spots on my face from breakouts and uneven skintone it's been around 15 days since I started using it and I have noticed spots are lighter than before and I can see my skintone getting even than before. Its easily observe in the skin within a minute.The only downside is it's smell but it's not pungent or discomforting one.\n",
      " I bought it for my mom as she was having problems related to her skin like hyperpigmentation. Being in her 50s she has a well managed diet plan and routine. The package delivered was suitable and fine look wise. But, after applying on face for a week, her forehead started to develop rashes accompanied by itchiness. She had to literally stop it and wait till it heals which took  more than two weeks. Personally I would not recommend this product to any of the ladies out there. It's just a waste of money and time. And ofcourse, I won't get a refund or payback. I am surely disappointed, dissatisfied, and annoyed.\n",

      " Hello everyone, Please buy this product only if you are looking for \"Moisturizer\" .This works as a great moisturizer and it does the job what it claims for but not 100%.Iam writing this review after 1 month of usage and realised that this is a product where 30ml  isn't available in original website of \"Mamaearth , I  figured out only after purchasing 50 ml from original website of Mamaearth.Ingredients: If you compare the ingredients of 30ml and 50ml : 30ml contains all the chemicals and 50ml consists of all the essential oils which is great.Scent: 30ml bottle has great smell coz all the chemicals are added.50ml bottle has the smell of essential oils which most of them might not like it( Hardly any chemical is added)This I figured out after using the 30ml which I purchased from Amazon and I used it exactly for 1 month and bottle got over, then I was looking to buy another one and I went to Mamaearth original site and figured out this .I would recommend you to compare the ingredients before you buy this from Amazon\n",

      " I am writing this review after using it around 20 days. It seems very natural and chemical free and is very gentle on skin. But it does its job of cleaning the skin properly. It contains tea tree which is one of my favourite ingredients for skin care. Give it a try... its definitely better than all other chemicals containing face washes.And its even affordable as compared to other natural brands available in market.\n",
      " Though it is pricey but quality comes at a price. It is free of chemicals so a healthy option for skin. Gives results on acne prone face in 7-8 days. Cleanses face very well and quantity required is also less. This will b my face wash for years to come.\n",
      " This face wash is amazing guys. I've oily skin. Every now and then my face breaks out. But when I first time used this within 4 wash my pimples were gone! I'm not jocking guys. This face wash does wonders. I use it two times daily, after waking up in the morning and before going to bed. Now I'm using it for two months. And I don't  a single pimple past two months. For every oily skin acne prone beauties I'll recommend this facewash.\n",
      " I have oily to combination skin. During Monsoons, my skin becomes even oilier due to humidity and also it becomes more prone to breakouts. I have been using this face wash for quite some time now and it works amazing on my skin. It extracts the excess oil from my skin and leaves it clean but not dehydrated. Also, I haven't faced any breakout on my face since I've started using it.\n",
      " Caused too much pimples on dry and sensitive skin. Would recommend VLCC for such skin type as it doesn't atleast have any side effects. Very disappointed by Mamaearth. Had a hell a lot of expectations.\n",
      " I really love services of amazon their delivery their return policy their  packing.Their service towards their customers its applicable.Now product- 3.5 star  Average plus product. odour of the material i didn't like. It smells like medicated facewash. I dont know whether it fights with acne or pimple. I wasn't having any pimple or acne issues but only for concern i switched to herbal facewash and first i picked aroma magic tea tree oil face which was good i applied it on my face for several months but suddenly some acne and pimple attack on my face i didn't know the cause and then i switched to mamaearth face wash but it did nothing on my face used it for 15 days no result i got. Both the product were fail to cure my pimple or acneI don't know what kind of pimple attack it was. only two or three pimple used to occur after healing that again two or three. OMG finally i consulted to doctor.Both the product i purchased with recommandation of fit tuber on YouTube.If your face is free of pimples or acne then you can use these products by replacing chemical products. But if you're suffering from pimples or acne i dont know both the facewashes will work or not. Because everybody has their own skin and their own causes of occuring pimples or acnes.You can buy and try.\n",
      " I have acne prone oily skin.. thought this product will help reducing them and also stop further breakouts.. I am reviewing after 1month of use.. this product is of no use.\n",
      " I love Mamaearth products and have been using them since six months now. Was looking for a facewash for acne for my mom when I stumbled across Mamaearth's new range of face washes. All the products are chemical free and this one is really gentle on the skin. This comes in an easy squeezy tube. The facewash is clear like a gel and have tea tree fragrance. it really helps fighting acne and in almost two uses, my mother was really impressed. A must buy for anyone fighting acne.\n",
      " I m editing this review on 11/5/2020, my experience with this product is so disappointing.its quality is lower than regular soap , for any skin type I don't recommend to buy this, not worth for money, it just clean your face with water that's all it do, it's a scam, I bought this product after watching fit YouTubber channel, and I wasted my money; I say don't go after product that says it's natural it's a big scam , not only they don't work on you but they come very very expensive , I use home remedies and some regular Market product.\n",
      " I have sensitive and acne prone skin. More than active acne i have scars on my face. This face wash shows visible results after 1 usage only. It is very gentle on skin, has a pleasant and mild fragrance. Does not rip off the natural oil from your face, leaves your face deeply cleansed and smooth after wash. It is complete value for money\n",

I wasn't having any pimple or acne issues but only for concern i switched to herbal facewash and first i picked aroma magic tea tree oil face which was good i applied it on my face for several months but suddenly some acne and pimple attack on my face i didn't know the cause and then i switched to mamaearth face wash but it did nothing on my face used it for 15 days no result i got. Both the product were fail to cure my pimple or acneI don't know what kind of pimple attack it was. only two or three pimple used to occur after healing that again two or three. OMG finally i consulted to doctor.Both the product i purchased with recommandation of fit tuber on YouTube.If your face is free of pimples or acne then you can use these products by replacing chemical products. But if you're suffering from pimples or acne i dont know both the facewashes will work or not. Because everybody has their own skin and their own causes of occuring pimples or acnes.You can buy and try.\n",
      " I have acne prone oily skin.. thought this product will help reducing them and also stop further breakouts.. I am reviewing after 1month of use.. this product is of no use.\n",
      " I love Mamaearth products and have been using them since six months now. Was looking for a facewash for acne for my mom when I stumbled across Mamaearth's new range of face washes. All the products are chemical free and this one is really gentle on the skin. This comes in an easy squeezy tube. The facewash is clear like a gel and have tea tree fragrance. it really helps fighting acne and in almost two uses, my mother was really impressed. A must buy for anyone fighting acne.\n",
      " I m editing this review on 11/5/2020, my experience with this product is so disappointing.its quality is lower than regular soap , for any skin type I don't recommend to buy this, not worth for money, it just clean your face with water that's all it do, it's a scam, I bought this product after watching fit YouTubber channel, and I wasted my money; I say don't go after product that says it's natural it's a big scam , not only they don't work on you but they come very very expensive , I use home remedies and some regular Market product.\n",
      " I have sensitive and acne prone skin. More than active acne i have scars on my face. This face wash shows visible results after 1 usage only. It is very gentle on skin, has a pleasant and mild fragrance. Does not rip off the natural oil from your face, leaves your face deeply cleansed and smooth after wash. It is complete value for money\n",
      " I am writing this review after using it around 20 days. It seems very natural and chemical free and is very gentle on skin. But it does its job of cleaning the skin properly. It contains tea tree which is one of my favourite ingredients for skin care. Give it a try... its definitely better than all other chemicals containing face washes.And its even affordable as compared to other natural brands available in market.\n",
      " Though it is pricey but quality comes at a price. It is free of chemicals so a healthy option for skin. Gives results on acne prone face in 7-8 days. Cleanses face very well and quantity required is also less. This will b my face wash for years to come.\n",
      " This face wash is amazing guys. I've oily skin. Every now and then my face breaks out. But when I first time used this within 4 wash my pimples were gone! I'm not jocking guys. This face wash does wonders. I use it two times daily, after waking up in the morning and before going to bed. Now I'm using it for two months. And I don't  a single pimple past two months. For every oily skin acne prone beauties I'll recommend this facewash.\n",
      " I have oily to combination skin. During Monsoons, my skin becomes even oilier due to humidity and also it becomes more prone to breakouts. I have been using this face wash for quite some time now and it works amazing on my skin. It extracts the excess oil from my skin and leaves it clean but not dehydrated. Also, I haven't faced any breakout on my face since I've started using it.\n",
      " Caused too much pimples on dry and sensitive skin. Would recommend VLCC for such skin type as it doesn't atleast have any side effects. Very disappointed by Mamaearth. Had a hell a lot of expectations.\n",

      " Mamaearth is always best.  Every product of this brand is awesome.  I love all babies products by Mamaearth. Best part of this soap is SUITABLE FOR EVERY BABY'S DELICATE SKIN even you can try it for your newborns as well.  I'm using it for my baby since birth. Quality same as mentioned. The natural nutrients present in goat milk gets easily absorbed in the delicate skin of your baby and keeps it moisturized for long time.SUITS DRY, ITCHY, ECZEMA PRONE SKIN as well.  Best product. You can purchase it for your baby or for gifting for your loved ones.\n",
      " Update: horrible bathing that I have used so far... My 3 year old son developed hives after using the soap and more over it turned him dark... Fragrance too strong... It literally hits you.. Will never buy again...The bar is ok ok... Not so good as it claims.... I used on my kid and feel it doesn't cleanse well.  I have a dry skin... I used for myself on face and found that my skin is still dry after washing... So nothing great about the moisturising part and more over I don't feel fresh after washing my face with this bar... Its like I haven't washed my face.  So I really doubt if it cleanses ur skin.\n",
      " Although, it makes a very rich and creamy lather, it starts melting quickly if kept wet. I need to take it out of the bathroom and dry it for the next use as I want to save as much of it as possible because it's costlier than other brands. But, it does a far better job than other brands and it's organic. I'm happy to have this soap in my skincare regimen as an adult who has a very sensitive skin prone to irritation. The best thing about this soap is it doesn't leave any residue, which I'm surprised to see. Other brands leave a thin film which makes skin feel very slippery and smooth and I don't like that. I want my skin to feel naked, fresh and not stripped with moisture. Mamaearth soap as well as the mamaearth baby wash did an excellent job. :)\n",
      " Very bad product worth ZERO star. The entire soap turn into a pasty mass after one time use. Not worth buying this product as the second day onwards one has to scoop it with hand like a cream and apply on baby. Bad manufacturing process for this soap. Better they market it in the form of liquid body wash. Moreover, the soapy feel doesn't go from the body on few rinse. Worst than Teddy bar which has similar outcome, but better than this. Dermadew found to best on my trials to find a good soap for my baby.\n",
      " I avoided the previous negative reviews for this item and trusted mama earth brand but I'm sharing this review after 2 weeks of use. On 1st day itself I got rashes on my skin but I ignored it. Later on my whole face got rashes and small boils. My skin became too dry and spotty. I used it with mama earth baby cream still my skin was drying out giving me many burns on face. I stopped using this item and continued my cetaphil cleansing lotion. I will never use mama earth's any product again. I threw away the soaps and moisturizer.\n",
      " I really have started appreciating this brand as the product they made really works well and best part is they are made from safe ingredients. This baby soap is been enriched with goodness  goat milk, oatmeal, Shea butter and coconut based cleanser. The skin of my toddler feels so soft after bath. The shape of the soap is perfect for little one to hold as well. No tears formula of soap is working great. It is very gentle on the skin. The fragrance is so amazing. I highly recommend this moisturizing bath to all mommies and daddies. I specially recommend it for toddlers who are in phase where they want to be independent and bath by themselves.\n",
      " Everytime I used to search baby soap when one going to finish.this time I heard about mamaearth baby soap.lets try but it's been a week i am using it for my daughter.now I think my search now going to be ended.it is very mild which is good for baby skin\n",
      " A gentle cleansing soap that doesn't dry out skin and leaves a lingering baby fragrance after use. Yet another fabulous stellar product by Mamaearth,  makes a  perfect gift for a baby hamper too.\n",
      " The soap is really good and I really appreciate its quality. It leaves baby's skin soft, moisturized and doesn't dry it out at all. However, only after 2 days of use, the soap became a lump of cream and I literally have to keep it in a bowl and scoop out little at a time, like cream to use it. Mamaearth please do something about it without compromising on the quality.\n",
      " The soap is creamy and less foamy which means it is sulfate free and has fresh coconut fragrance . You will feel the difference in your babys skin the day you start using it. The packaging is Excellent!!! I give it more than five starts\n",

      " The scent and feel of the hand wash seems different from earlier ones as I have been using this brand purechased from  Amazon dealers only since last six months.

      " This handwash gives a mild scent and very good on pocket. A little liquid spreads well and lathers up well to clean hands efficiently. The reduced MRP makes it more affordable and an added gain. One of the first products in our most essential lists.\n",

Very refreshing fragnance which can be felt as soon as u enter bathroom. Does its job well, is soft on skin. What more do u want. Go for it ( made in india)  ;)\n",
      " This is very good quality of soap compared to other soaps And this is cheaper too.. This is made from too grade raw materials. After cinthol original I'm using this soap I'm happy with it. Fragrance is average good it has lemon so it's refreshing.\n",
      " Firstly keeping in mind its a budget soap this pack of 4 is really nice and the quality of the soap is good and it has a lovely citrus smell i have tried other godrej soaps but this one is really refreshing for summer days\n",
      " Godrej No.1 lime is value for money soap.Each soap is 150gms and 4 soaps are sold as bundle. Soap dissolves less in water which ensures that it will last long.Very refreshing and lemon fragrance is good for hot summer days. 😀\n",
      " Eight soaps delivered while the packing was of 9\n",
      " Got it at  Rs.89.00/-.Fregrance is too good. Long lasting up-to 2-6 hours depends on the situation.At this price, good soap.\n",
      " Good soap with nice fragrance\n",
      " Godrej No.1 Sandal Turmeric soaps are extremely value for money as they do not dissolve easily in water resulting in greater longevity.Sandal fragrance is subtle and keeps you fresh after bath.Package includes 4 soaps each of 150gm.Thanks to Amazon Pantry for safe and timely delivery.\n",
      " It's a very good soap which gives sufficient lather and cleans the body. Also leaves a very good fragrance.\n",
      " I really don't give out 5 stars lightly. But I LOVE this soap. It smells great. It lasts longer than others sandalwood soaps I've tried. It lathers very well, rinses away well. And the fragrance lasts for a little while afterwards. No drying, sticky residue. Does the job well done ✅. And the amount of bars for the price is an added bonus. I have tried the other well known brand and I like this better.\n",
      " Item is ok. Costlier (Rs 76 ) than MRP Price.\n",
      " Itz lyk mysore Sandal.. But mysore Sandal comes only 10 to 13 days for my kids to bath.. But this soap come one month for the same usage.. Value for money\n",
      " Havn't expected such a low standard soap from Godrej, the scent is just for the first time as if it is applied on top of the soap, longevity also less, the soap vanishes in less than a week for two people and two times a day\n",
      " The soap doesn't feels good to me. Appears a bit hard. Although price wise its cheap but I personally didn't like it.\n",
      " I was mislead by the reviews. Overall, its a cheap soap. There are definitely better soaps of Sandal available in the market from different brands.\n",

      " I've been using this Godrej aer pocket for a couple of years now. Yes I understand that the fragrance doesn't last for more than a week. It is very strong the first couple of days and rest of the times it is just a light hint of the scent. Then the gel eventually crystallizes.I figured out a way for a 'juggad'. Basically I never take the gel pack out of the plastic cover. There is a hole at the top to hang individual packs for store displays that I cut. Then with scissors, I carefully make 3 slender cuts. This makes the scent come out soft and not too powerful. It lasts for almost 20 days this way. The violet fragrance (purple) lasts for 25 days with this.Hope this review is helpful.\n",
      " These champs are better considering they are way to different from the Odonil fresheners we have been using for ages (it's basic law of diminishing returns) I'll encourage you to try them for their fragrance, and they are apt for any room in your apartment. When newly opened the fragrance is too strong that i would kick you in the face with it, but it dissolves when you give it a couple of days.Another good part about this is the concept of hanging it, I usually do in the fall ceiling of my washrooms, and it works pretty well.Word of caution: Don't expect it to last a month, because mine never have. Maximum 20 to 22 days, and then you'll want to replace it with a new one, but if you grab it on a deal on Amazon Pantry, it's quite economical\n",
      " Used this product.fragrance is excellent and of my liking. Very effective for closed spaces including car, toilet, bathroom, offices etc. Easy to install so no zanzat. Fragrance lasts roughly fifteen days, but during this period it should please you and your guests.\n",
      " Seems duplicate product as the fragrance has faded after 5 days of use. Amazon authorities please do a check with supplier of this product,I think now I cannot return the item as I hv opened the packet,but how a buyer can be sure about the product without using the item??I think this can be a fit case to be filed with consumer forum.Buyers DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.SUNIL\n",
      " On each box the MRP is mentioned as rs 160 , for pack of 3 packs it become rs480 but they are selling at rs495 for 3 boxes ,Kindly take a action against this\n",
      " I am overall happy with this product. But if you want to maintain freshness in your toilet area make sure you buy little more quantities of this product as it doesn't last very longer in my frank opinion. No complaints about fragrance. You would surely love it. So go check this out. Very Good product. It wouldn't disappoint you.\n",
      " The smell did not last for a week also. It was strong on the first day. After that one couldn't make out the presence of this product at all.\n",
      " I think one the best product I have used...It just freshens ur mood... Better than its odonil counterparts... The scent spreads evenly.. just go for it..\n",
      " Some of the packet looks like they have leaked and it is wet all over when you open the seal.  The fragrance does not last for 30 days.  It starts off with very strong smell and within a week it just fades.\n",
      " The misty had kind of a soapy smell but works. Smell is pleasant but hardly you would know about the smell unless you get close to it. The citrus has a sort of tangy smell but i find it better than the misty. Will have to try the violet. Initial days your room will be filled with the pleasant smell but a packet  lasts only for like 14 days. In the latter days you will completely forget about it. If you have the shell to spend then go for it.\n",

      " To start off, the safe arrived with a Low Battery message, meaning that before I could do anything else, I had to go and get new batteries for this brand new item. Once you get things in order, the safe works well and serves its purpose, however, the manual provided is obsolete, and the instructions do not match up with this product. There are no solutions posted online either. If you want to program the safe, you have to figure it out on your own. The customer service personnel were not helpful either and they kept trying to force me to get a technician to come to my house at the cost of Rs. 500 just to program the device, which completely defeats the purpose of online shopping. Don't fall for it. This is rather ridiculous for such a big brand like Godrej.In case anyone else needs to re-program their home code, here is what I was able to do. I hope it works for you too:1.) The instructions indicate to press 68#, but it actually means 68(Lock). If the instructions indicate *, try pressing Clear2.) Every time I pressed 68#, I got an error message, so I had to go through all the steps listed below.3.)

      " Very bad product. The code doesn’t work suddenly. Trying to open it with override key n it won’t open. Tried calling the customer care n they say, I will be charged Rs.500 for the technician visit. It is only 2 months I bought it. Very bad product.\n",
      " To start off, the safe arrived with a Low Battery message, meaning that before I could do anything else, I had to go and get new batteries for this brand new item. Once you get things in order, the safe works well and serves its purpose, however, the manual provided is obsolete, and the instructions do not match up with this product. There are no solutions posted online either. If you want to program the safe, you have to figure it out on your own. The customer service personnel were not helpful either and they kept trying to force me to get a technician to come to my house at the cost of Rs. 500 just to program the device, which completely defeats the purpose of online shopping. Don't fall for it. This is rather ridiculous for such a big brand like Godrej.In case anyone else needs to re-program their home code, here is what I was able to do. I hope it works for you too:1.) The instructions indicate to press 68#, but it actually means 68(Lock). If the instructions indicate *, try pressing Clear2.) Every time I pressed 68#, I got an error message, so I had to go through all the steps listed below.3.) Before you can change personal code in home mode, you will need to Access The Programming (pg. 6). The code is 751019 which means that there are 6 different features that you can program. Go through all the steps and change the numbers as they suit you. When you get to the last digit, there are no instructions written in the book, so you will have to figure this out on your own. If the last digit is 1, change it to 0 or 9.4.) After going through the programming and changing the last number, you should be able to go back to change the personal code in home mode.5.) If you set your password and it doesn't lock, go back to the programming again, and change the last digit back to what it was originally.Good luck.\n",
      " Received damaged product. The case is scratched in multiple places and all the parts are loose. Looks like  a duplicate box with iron is painted and set up with godrej tag and sent to us. Highly dissatisfied with the product quality\n",
      " The product was good. But starting it for the first time took me several hours to start and install it properly.Here I will list out all steps so that reading this other people might find it helpful.1. Unwrap the package properly. Look for any damages.2. You will find a set of keys attached in a plastic sachet.3. Use the key to open the locker. There is a white cover near the button panel ,open it to insert keys.4. Inside the locker you will find the manual and wall mounting knots.5. The other side of the keypad panel will contain the battery space which needs 4 AA batteries for the led to start. But before inserting the batteries do see the positive & negative marked side and insert the batteries according to the charge respectively.6. Close the battery lid and led will automatically start working. The battery lid needs a small screw to get fixed. so if u don't find the screw in any plastic packets then use another aftermarket screws or maybe the screw is present inside the locker mechanism.7. The locker mechanism screws can be unlocked by a particular opener which will be given with the mounting knots inside the locker.8. The locker is now ready to use. Remove the keys and use the led to unlock and lock it. The default password is 1234.9. Please donot apply any pressure or try to press the firm bolts of the locker mechanism when the locker is open. Let the motor of the locker do its work.10. If the locker shows any other error message. Do consult the user manual.Note. Please be calm and do things properly or else you might damage the product.\n",
      " Easy to operate.But installation is a head breaking thing. After repeated calls to Godrej customer care, finally they came after 20 days and charged 750 rupees for installation. Good for small stuff. Light weight hence it needs to be mounted in cupboard or wall otherwise it is light enough to be carried and run ;-) Best thing is that I got it in a deal 4200.\n",
      " How to set new password in home mode , there is no # key as mentioned in manual. Idot seller and supplier.Double click clear button- enter 751019-enter 171310- press lock three times- enter new password -enter lock .done new password is setIt is good safe\n",
      " First it is made in China product which I was not expecting from Godrej.The safe arrived with dent and chipped paint at two places.manual with the product is obsolete.Instruction indicating 68# to program the lock but there is no # key on key pad, door was not align.Totally dissatisfied with the product quality.\n",
      " The reason I declined the purchase was that it was to light.A thief can easily take it and open it in their own sweet time.Therefore I declined the purchase\n",
      " Good product and provides good security. Provides a master pwd which can be used even if we forget regular pwd.Executive has provided DEMO on time after taking appointment by calling customer care. Charged 300/- for demo & installation.\n",
      " I love this digital safe locker. Now I can put all my important stuff inside this box. The good thing is that it is not that bulky. The material is also very good, seems very strong and heavy. And, It is very easy to install. I have not mounted/fixed it because I put this inside the almera. Now I can feel safer by keeping cash, passport and other valuable stuff.Lookwise also it just has a classy touch. It has a proper colored LED display. It works on the battery power and the consumption is very low. You can set your own passcode from the 4-8 digits. I like it beep sound whenever you have to press the keys. In addition it also has 2 emergency keys. Overall now I am very calm ever since this digital safe has been arrived. Of course now I can manage my things for my own peace of mind according to my needs :-).Earlier I never ever used such kind of digital safe but after have been started using  this I found this as exactly as what I expected for.

      " Highly dissatisfied with the product. Received in package opened condition. Perfume bottle was almost empty. Though it was specified as returnable, but return not accepted. Finally it's defective one as it's not spraying after 10 mins, only the green light blinking and not starting spray even after 10 hrs. They say it's so designed. Ridiculous I think. Moreover I bought। Another bottle of fragrance but it's emptied within 2/3 days and 2/3 hrs a day of use. Though it was said to last 20000 sprays. That's the product.\n",
      " The smell is good but the arrmatic spray is not functioning properly. I have airwick also and airwick aermatic sprayers are excellent. Use Godrej refills with airwick sprayers. They fit perfectly\n",
      " Money wasted. The product does not work properly.  It sprayed 4-5 times, making me dispose the bill and box and it stopped working from next day. I had used Air Wick earlier and that worked perfectly. Avoid this product and from the seller as he may be clearing his defect stock.\n",
      " I really liked this product at first. I also loved the fragrance of lavender. But after 2 months, the motor stopped pressing the refill hard enough and the fragrance stopped. I changed the batteries but it was of no use. I even got Duracell batteries. It's of no use. The motor is not strong enough. Bad experience.\n",
      " Really disappointed with this product. It’s not even a month and this product is spraying continuously within seconds. I tried setting the timer on 10,20 and 40min intervals but it sprays within seconds. Can’t even return the product now because it is out of return window. The fragnance is pretty good but can’t believe that the machinery of this product have timer issues in just less than a month of use. Totally not recommended if you are bot looking to buy this product every month.\n",
      " Godrej failed to deliver the quality i expected , perfume of the spray lasted for just 10 days and after 10 day's only gas was coming out from the refill and smell of the perfume was very less ,so i am not getting any kind of perfume  smell in my room  , don't buy it i also wrote a complaint to godrej consumer products regarding this issue of selling me inferior quality product which does not meets their reputation\n",

      " The product was defective. The front keypad panel was not sitting properly. Same was immediately observed on receiving and opening the product.

      " The product is good. The only caveat (as I have noticed so far) is to be careful with the alarm. Don't keep stuff on it after switching the alarm on. Second, I think the alarm tone itself should change. It needs to be ALARMING. The volume needs to be a bit on the higher side as well. One can easily muffle the sound with a blanket type of fabric and make a getaway. That said, it is quite a sleek gadget. Definitely worth more than what one would be paying for. It's a bit heavy, but I guess that needs to be part of the \"package\" so to speak.\n",
      " This is very handy and useful. I keep it inside my wardrobe and store my wallet, car key and other loose currency and change in it when I come back from office.

It works flawlessly and is very easy to operate.  If I want to lock all the other wardrobes at home while going out somewhere, I keep the keys inside this.  no need to carry so many keys with me. One needs to know the purpose of this safe and the way to use it.\n",
      " Using it since November 2016.Sleek and elegant. Sits nicely in my cupboard.Useful to keep certain small sized valuables like keys,cash,jewelry,certain documents,watches etc.The touch panel is great, feels soft and is responsive.Velvet lining is great.Portable.Only con I found is that it buzzez even if you close the cupboard door a bit hard.Other than that, Its good to have it.Note: Its not a regular heavy duty safe. Its more of a personal locker as mentioned. Don't expect it to be the most secure thing you can have.\n",
      " Bought godrej goldilock in the Amazon diwali sale.. In The product that I got,was having some scratches already. Still I kept it.  I wanted to disable the theft alarm because it gives a loud sound even if we move the goldilock slightly, which is very annoying. I tried to disable the feature but it was not getting disabled. The godrej executive also couldn't do it.. He told some problem is there in pcb and I should return the product.. I did it.. I got the product replaced by Amazon the very next day...Now the new product also has same problem. We cannot disable the alarm. Also it has one additional problem...when we close its lid, it sometimes doesn't get locked. After 2-3 attempts, it gets locked..Now I am confused, what to do with this.. I trusted godrej brand and Amazon.. But the satisfaction level is not at all there\n",
      " Awesome packaging done by amazon !!Product review:Pros: 1.Easy to Carry  2.Touch screen is absolutely smooth.  3.Working mini safe with a primitive touch screen run by a 9 volt battery..well that is awesome.  4.Developers and Designers have done a great job in creating a sleek and stylish safe.Cons:  1.Although the safe looks great..not much space to place enough valuables.If u place a mobile,wallet and a wristwatch..space is done for.  2.Inner layer of the safe is made by a grossest material.It's so rough that it can scratch the back side of your iphone if haven't placed carefully.  3.Wiring for this safe can be done better.  4.Default battery provided to you will be a GP 9 volt alkaline battery,Mine was pretty much messySo to sum this up,a fine product for occasional use (routine if you are thrifty enough to spend bucks on batteries) with a stylish look ✌🏻\n",
      " I recently gifted this item to my parents on their anniversary. However the product is good and easy to use with a very responsive touch panel , it has to be absolutely stationary else the alarm sets off which makes it difficult to carry during transportation.Also the Godrej support team is not quick in answering your queries and I received a product which had few scratches on it. So, Amazon should ensure that the product appears brand new since the customers are paying them for a brand new product.  Overall it's worth buying for your security needs.\n",
      " Product Is Excellent but the packaging was really terrible, I was shocked to see the box damaged like it was thrown in the warehouse or something, luckily the product was in mint condition.The locker is very very useful when you have domestic help around, this locker shall actually keep you stress free, the locker is very easy to operate during day or night due to led backlit number which are illuminated, overall a great buy wish Amazon improves the packaging on this product in the future.....\n",
      " If you have maids in the house and want to keep valuables like wallets and regular use small jewellery under lock and key while they go about their household chores and you don't want to carry physical keys either for fear of misplacing and searching for them or simply inconvenient for you, then this is the product to go for. It's small enough to sit on your study table or fit in your cupboard drawer..although you must understand That it can't fit more than 3 or 4 regular size men's wallets and some other knickknacks like ear rings, chains, cards etc. Easy to operate and install by reading instructions in manual.

      " My vegetables and fruit turned Black next day after UV treatments. I am not sure is it 4 tubes give access exposure .Now I am worried if it is good idea to use it for vegetables sanitization....\n",
      " Box seems good and alarm is set after 15 minutes and not 6 minutes as written in the discription . there is no indicator.How do we know that all four uv lights are working properly? In case any light is not working, how will we get to know?\n",
      " Thank you for changing the timer\n",
      " Does its job. It has 4 lamps and mirrors on all sides unlike most competitors that have 2 lamps. Only grouse is the 15 minute timer is useless. I don't need to expose any object for 15 minutes. I open the box after 5 or 6 minutes. Should be enough when competitors whose boxes have only 2 lamps recommend 4 minutes to disinfect.Edit: The company replaced the timer from the previous 15 mins to 6 minutes on their own.\n",
      " Best Product in these price segment.\n",
      " The product specifications do not match the details on Amazon. NO BUZZER SOUND. No indicator lights either. You just have to wait like a fool to estimate the disinfection cycle which is claimed to last for 6 minutes. If you want it to be 20 minutes you either can have 18 minutes or 24 minutes and that too without any indications. Hope it has the genuine UV lights and the claim is not false on that count as well!GODREJ COULD NOT BE WORST THAN THIS!\n",
      " The product is useless, There is no indicator for power on,There is proper response either from Amazon and manufacturers.The customer care axecutive is not at all helpful. Want to return but customer care executive is not helpful.\n",
      " 4 lights are very useful for effective sanitization but they produce a bit more heat which is a kind of side effect. Depends on what you put inside the box .\n",
      " Overall Price is WORTH IT!Fits Laptop upto 14.1”, Helmet smaller size only, fruits and vegetable all can be put without issues. Looks pretty decent for your home!But;1. Smells horrible after every cycle (room gets polluted)2. One rack means effectively you can place 10-12 soaps.3. If you over stack them no disinfection possible. Take caution and do less and more cycles to ensure4. One switch operation (plug & play). Timer is to be followed manually or wait for beep (no display if you are curious to know what time has lapsed)5. Wire is three pin, so the earthing is critical, I felt some mild shocks.\n",
      " Useless product of two accounts:1. There is no timer. There is a flat cycle of 6 minutes before the buzzer rings2. The moment you open the door while the device is working, you can see the UV lamps for a fraction of a second which is a health hazard.This is a classic product where the practicality and safety have been ignored to cash into the fear pshycosis of the customers.\n",
      " My vegetables and fruit turned Black next day after UV treatments. I am not sure is it 4 tubes give access exposure .Now I am worried if it is good idea to use it for vegetables sanitization....\n",
      " Box seems good and alarm is set after 15 minutes and not 6 minutes as written in the discription . there is no indicator.How do we know that all four uv lights are working properly? In case any light is not working, how will we get to know?\n",
      " Thank you for changing the timer\n",
      " Does its job. It has 4 lamps and mirrors on all sides unlike most competitors that have 2 lamps. Only grouse is the 15 minute timer is useless. I don't need to expose any object for 15 minutes. I open the box after 5 or 6 minutes. Should be enough when competitors whose boxes have only 2 lamps recommend 4 minutes to disinfect.Edit: The company replaced the timer from the previous 15 mins to 6 minutes on their own.\n",
      " Best Product in these price segment.\n",
      " The product specifications do not match the details on Amazon. NO BUZZER SOUND. No indicator lights either. You just have to wait like a fool to estimate the disinfection cycle which is claimed to last for 6 minutes. If you want it to be 20 minutes you either can have 18 minutes or 24 minutes and that too without any indications.

When i opened the box, to my disappointment i found the thin plastic that covers a new watch glass face is all crumpled up to a corner. I was scared thinking the glass face must be damaged, but thank God it wasnt the case. Also there's no dealer stamp in the warranty card.My take: if you really like what you see, go for it. And if you are scared to buy online then buy it from the brick mortar shops, cause its worth it.\n",

      " Got it to gift a groom at his wedding. Beautiful timepiece. In fact I loved it do much I'm getting one for myself. The black dial and the silver hands and silver marking makes the functioning of the watch look stunning and royal. Dial size is just right. It is definitely not small and it is not very big either. It looks very well balanced on the wrist. And the metal bracelet that comes with it is beautiful and goes perfectly with the timepiece dimension wise and there's no mismatch between them. Go for it without any second guessing. You'll love it ❤️ Thank you Amazon and thank you Titan. Both amazing companies and now you both have a very very happy and loyal customer in me for life.\n",

But the chain strap should have been more elegant and thee locking system shld have been easy. All in all this watch didn't disappoint me.\n",

I give it to my father (60) also.May work as an antidepressant too.Not a sweetner. But  a nutrient rich food.First 2-3 days it was difficult to eat but now its good. After all health is wealth.Great work Amul #FIT INDIA MOVEMENTDo not discontinue production this chocolate AMUL like you did for 90% cocoa. Retain this as your permanent product. Please give micronutrients information also in the chocolate.\n",
      " All the chocolate lovers will love this chocolate! (P.S. I said chocolate lovers not sugar lovers.). It's absolutely one of the best dark chocolates in India. You can go for it only if you are a die hard fan of cocoa! Order delivered was absolutely fresh and was in the finest state.\n",
      " Chocolate didn't melt in transit to Bhubaneswar( doesn't melt in transit to Bengaluru either).I love dark chocolate and can eat comfortably till Amul 90%, so wanted to try the ultimate 99% but found it a little too bitter for my taste so now I use it to make hot chocolate and it tastes much better than Hershey's. Just chop this chocolate into small pieces and stir it in your milk!\n",
      " Bitter is a very silple word, need some terrible word to describe this, i don't think i can go beyond 70% cocao... now i don't know what i will do with two bars.... on a lighter note: guys think twice before ordering, this is some 3rd degree torture not for general public use, might help military to torture terrorists. If i was a terrorist i would speak out everything after eating this in return of sugar..Jokes apart guys this is best and cheapest you can get, well done,  amul really the taste of india ❤❤❤\n",

Thanks to AMUL, now we have true dark chocolate at affordable price.NB: Loving the texture and feel of the chocolate. I'm really happy.Update: Finished 4 packs in less than 13 days. Ordered another 4. I just love the texture of the chocolate in my mouth. Truly in love ❤️\n",
      " It's literally heavenly feeling to taste this chocolate. The chocolate is bitter to the core. It has no added suger. Sugery chocolate/fake chocolate lovers won't like it. It's for those people who has developed taste for cocoa/cacao over the period of time. It's made for chocolate connoisseur. Price is very less when compare to other brands in market. Plus Amul is well-known brand itself. Packaging was nice.\n",
      " I simply love this pure cocoa taste....not sure if people consider this bitter, I personally do not feel so, may be very mildly. But the cocoa taste, flavor indeed feels great.I had earlier tasted upto 90% dark among the Amul chocolates (& of course couple of other makes including Lindt). In fact I have graduated in darkness with Amul's progression in a way starting at 55% then 75, 90 and now 99% - in fact love the whole range by Amul. As long as this range is available I will never have to look beyond for Dark chocolates. Thanks Amul. In fact on an earlier occasion I had purchased 99% dark of some other make and did not like the flavor at all - strangely it had kind of a sourish smell and so far a bit hesitant with this item as well at first.Another thing the chocolates were delivered superbly packaged - thanks to the seller. Had a carton box outside and inside of it the chocolate packs had a layer of some kind of gel filled plastic bags to keep the chocolates at non melting temperature....pretty cool - so no melting problem or anything for me.So this would be my daily dose of dark chocolate from now on like a cube (or sometimes two) after each meal - enjoyable in taste, and so sugar, no guilt!!\n",
      " So basically, this is not the chocolate for everyone. At first when I tasted it, I badly regretted buying it. It tasted nowhere near the chocolate you would find in the market. There isn't even the slightest hint of any kind of sweetness in it and most people would find it gross. But the more I ate it, the more I could feel it's richness and realised how decadent it is. It's not a chocolate, it's THE chocolate.\n",
      " Amul 99% cacao is the best dark/bitter chocolate available in India... excellent innovation by Amul. I may tell that I am not endorsing Amul or any other brand...just my own opinions. It has been proven that cacao is one of the healthiest superfoods on earth with amazing health benefits. It's full of antioxidants & flavonoids which increase lifespan. It's one of the highest sources of nitric oxide which dilates/widens & relaxes blood vessels of the body by reducing blockages, thereby supporting heart & brain health. Cacao is also anti inflammatory and anti carcinogenic, thus reduces cancer risk. Moreover, cacao is a natural blood thinner, so can prevent blood clots, reduce blood cholesterol & blood sugar and lower blood pressure. Overall Amul dark cacao chocolate has enormous health benefits...so we must be thankful to Amul for making such an awesome health food. Please ignore the negative and one star rated reviews as those people are ignorant and lack awareness. Requesting all the sugar lovers...please don't defame such a nice and healthy product by giving negative ratings and one star. I pity those innocent sweet toothed people which focus on tongue taste rather than general health. Again, I am not promoting Amul company or a representative of the same, these are my personal views & experience. Those who want to enhance quality of life and reduce onset of lifestyle/genetic diseases like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, heart attacks, cardiac arrest, etc must not think twice...just purchase the stuff & enjoy. Infact, Amul 99% Cacao Chocolate is a heavenly bliss with irresistible taste. It is indeed Delightful & Ambrosial. I am giving a five star rating to this authentic product...if there were 10 stars, I would have given full 10/10. Lastly, thanks to Amul & Amazon, too for providing such a nice superfood at my doorstep.\n",

But the problem has repeated. It does not solidify, & TASTES EVEN WORSE (directly & indirectly) than the 2nd time.p.s. my coffee ingredients are the same.No More Amul Ghee, guess a lot of potential for adulteration within their scope of products & quality control.

      " Guys dont order Amul ghee from amazon fresh the seller is selling some duplicate stuff.I got ill after having this.I hardly write reviews but this one i am writing just to warn all that don't purchase amul ghee from fresh at alllllll.You can see the picture.Even after putting it on burner it doesn't melt.\n",
      " 3rd time I've ordered this Ghee.*1st time: Ghee was perfect, it solidified, tasted gr8-directly & in my BulletProof Coffee.*2nd time: Tasted poor, directly & in my BPC, never solidified & my Mother said the same too.*3rd time: Thought the 2nd time was a batch problem. But the problem has repeated. It does not solidify, & TASTES EVEN WORSE (directly & indirectly) than the 2nd time.p.s. my coffee ingredients are the same.No More Amul Ghee, guess a lot of potential for adulteration within their scope of products & quality control. Mother Dairy, Dynamic much much better.Amul Ghee has lost a customer.\n",
      " Bad quality. I think Amul made this low quality product for online shopping perpose only.  Amul ghee from local shop, in tin container is GOOD.\n",

      " This product from patanjali can be a nightmare for your skin. Although the fragrance is good and it is a cheap product but that's all. I have normal skin and am not very prone to pimples. But after applying this gel for a couple of days, I started having pimples on my face. First I ignored, thinking it could be a result of the weather. But then the pimples started increasing. I immediately discontinued the product. But still I am unable to get rid of the pimples.\n",
      " I use this gel as my night cream and I am quite happy with it. It doesn't make me a beauty queen overnight, but moisturizes my skin the non-intrusive way, and thats what I need. The impact is for a short time, as it would 'naturally' be. Its a good replenishment especially in summers.Only thing I think they can improve is change the packaging and use a bit high quality one. The cap is quite sharp to open and close. This can hurt if not operated carefully. Secondly, its a tube. You usually, habitually, keep the tube inverted with cap down to take out the gel. When you open with cap down, the hard cap and not so thick gel work in conjunction and it opens with a jerk, throwing some of gel around, wasting as well as messing things around at times. I now, open the cap with cap on top and then invert the tube to take it out. I learnt after some messes. This is too much to be careful about and Patanjali sure needs to work on the packaging front of this gel.\n",

And it is affordable too 😁 peeps of my skin type just give it a shot. Just wash your face with low ph cleanser at night and apply it. leave it on till the next day mrng. Your skin will be so supple and soft. My acne got reduced eventually in 1month 😘\n",

When you open with cap down, the hard cap and not so thick gel work in conjunction and it opens with a jerk, throwing some of gel around, wasting as well as messing things around at times. I now, open the cap with cap on top and then invert the tube to take it out. I learnt after some messes. This is too much to be careful about and Patanjali sure needs to work on the packaging front of this gel.\n",

Won't buy again\n",

I ignored the comments that said the product is fake, but after I received the product I noticed colour of the soap is lighter than the soap that I bought from the local store and the soap is watery ke less viscous.

      " You might think you would buy a refill instead of a new bottle to save money or even reduce plastic use.However do not buy this refill. It is not the original dettol handwash.As soon as i refilled bottle and started using i noticed first color is lighter. Noticeably lighter. Then i noticed that the scent is very faint compared to original one from bottle.I ignored it because in times like these you cant be picky.Then two days later i noticed my skin peeling off like it never has before. I have used handwash for a long time it has never happened to me.I wouldn't even risk givin this pack away to someone for free because it is awful. So it will end up in dustbin.\n",
      " The product packaging was good. Inside the package, you get one 1500ml dettol liquid handwash.Now, there is one thing I'm extremely upset about which is that the liquid seems diluted. It's like someone mixed water in it. It doesn't feel like dettol at all. I'm not saying that it is fake or not but that's what I got. About the scent, it's not very strong.

      " Very effective. Active ingredients are  quaternary ammonium chloride compounds which are a very potent and effective disinfectant - you can find these in most non-bleach disinfectant solutions. This is not the same as Dettol antiseptic used for skin so do not use it for that purpose. I am glad that Dettol introduced this as it was difficult to find purpose-made disinfectant concentrates of this formulation - the alternative was Amway Pursue which is not only much more expensive but would involve the hassle of dealing with a pushy Amway salesperson. Anyways, this one has a strong menthol smell and a highly effective disinfectant so fantastic for household use. Also works for laundry, but use it as a pre-wash, with a full wash cycle afterwards to clean out any residues.Also, a word of caution with this and any other disinfectants - please use it wisely and not indiscriminately as overuse not only can damage the environment but kill of beneficial microorganisms and cause harmful ones to develop resistance.\n",
      " This is one of the best disinfectant I have ever used. It has a strong menthol smell which I just love. This is a multipurpose liquid ,which can be used to clean laundry, wipe the floor, used while shaving to cleanse the razor, kitchen and bathroom cleaning, can be added to bathing water while taking a bath (those who don't mind menthol smell). Mind you, this is not the good old detail antiseptic liquid which comes with the clear bottle and green cap,which  is handy for cuts and wounds. This is an disinfectant liquid used for household cleaning. I use this in the washing machine along with the normal liquid detergent and let me tell you,my clothes smell amazing after wash.  I would recommend you all to try this if you like strong menthol smell. I just love it.. 5 stars for the product.\n",
      " Best for during this hot day and pain in ass corona virus. If  Want to feel fresh , add this on and take bath. Perfect to maintain ur  hygiene And feel fresh during this summer. Stay safe\n",
      " I am juz happy to tey this out. It has strong mint flavour with sweet essence balanced for my usage in bathroom. Stays perfectly long for washroom and bathroom specially places which are more closed and secluded. Its essense could be felt after 12 hrs also. Trust me. I seldomly rate anyone. Its a good for my daily usages. A change from orignal 30 years old flavour :-) try it.\n",
      " Pretty cool and innovative stuff from Dettol. The minty flavor and then it gives tingling effects on the body.It's usually expensive than the lemon one but I suggest buy it when Amazon gives Especially Cloudtail India offers discount.

      " This is a nice and innovative product from Reckitt Benckiser. Amazon deserves thanks because this is not available in local medicine shops. Those who are complaining that this is not as strong as the original Dettol Antiseptic Liquid are comparing apples and oranges. This scented Dettol Disinfectant Liquid is ideal for baths and imparting a freshness to just washed clothes.\n",

      " Every household needs Dettol products and especially those which have kids around.This new Dettol disinfectant with menthol fragrance leaves a fresh feeling and smell in your entire house when used along with cleaning water!Recommended for cleaning and washing.\n",
      " Now I have tried all variants of dettol liquids and putting aside the added benefits of the antiseptic version, this one is the best among them. One capfull in a bucket of water and you will have the freshest of baths. Scent not as strong as antiseptic, but quite good. Recieved sealed bottle and next day delivery for prime and mfg date is the same month of order date, so really happy with the purchase.\n",
      " Already using dettol lime fresh (green) from its launch which is a great product but this menthol cool (blue) is best\n",
      " Very effective. Active ingredients are  quaternary ammonium chloride compounds which are a very potent and effective disinfectant - you can find these in most non-bleach disinfectant solutions. This is not the same as Dettol antiseptic used for skin so do not use it for that purpose. I am glad that Dettol introduced this as it was difficult to find purpose-made disinfectant concentrates of this formulation - the alternative was Amway Pursue which is not only much more expensive but would involve the hassle of dealing with a pushy Amway salesperson. Anyways, this one has a strong menthol smell and a highly effective disinfectant so fantastic for household use. Also works for laundry, but use it as a pre-wash, with a full wash cycle afterwards to clean out any residues.Also, a word of caution with this and any other disinfectants - please use it wisely and not indiscriminately as overuse not only can damage the environment but kill of beneficial microorganisms and cause harmful ones to develop resistance.\n",

      " What a gem from an old and trusted Indian brand. And such great value for money.The fragrance is nice powdery scent which is refreshing without being overpowering. The soap’s cleansing is good, not great. But it has a nice creaminess which is far beyond its modest price. In fact, it has a nice natural creaminess, and not the slipperiness of a Dove. Also, it seems to long last. A clear winner and will be a regular feature on my bathing rack.\n",
      " I liked the quality of the soap as it wasn't getting too chunky even if it stays wet for most part of the day. BUT, the DEO fragrance in body after taking bath with this soap *** All those are just marketing GIMMICKS. It's got no great fragrance than other soaps and actually it's just too minimal. Anyhow the product feels like of good quality.\n",
      " I really had liked the packing of this soap. But more than that, I remember as soon as I had unpacked it, the surprising fresh smell coming from it was amazing.The soap foam feels soft, rich and white. It moisturizes the skin perfectly. I have an oily skin so I wanted a soap which can balance the skin moisture, not over moisturizing not drying out the skin. And this soap pretty much does that.Also, it lasts for a good time, also most soaps give up their foaming capability as soon as they become small, but this one still gives great lather. Would recommend to everyone.\n",
      " Nice smelling scented bath soap from Cinthol. The scent lingers for a while even after washing off and leaves the bathroom also smelling great. Besides that it does its job of cleaning as it should. So full points there. Only thing is I was somewhat misguided and ordered a smaller pack when I needed a larger one.\n",
      " Nice quality product. Great product. Buying all the product from Amazon Pantry regularly.Thank you Amazon for such great quality products at such an affordable rate.\n",
      " I thought the product might be black or charcoal colour but it's a regular white one. The scent is not that great and didn't feel any difference btw normal average soap and this one. I feel the lime one is better than this. Its just a good marketing and nothing else.\n",
      " I placed order 4+1 soaps.But I have received without seal pack with 4 No's soaps only. Now how can get remaining soap.\n",
      " The soap is ok for bathing, no scent at all, more drier. The green one from cinthol is much better.\n",
      " For a long time I was searching for Indian soap equal to USA Ivory soap or the soap you get in Holiday Inn Hotels. Here it is!!!! Thank you Cinthol!\n",
      " While the discount was only Rs 7, I have no complaints as Amazon delivered this in peak Covid-19. Thank you to the delivery person. Soap is tried and tested and one of the best available in India for summer season with the DEO.\n",
      " What a gem from an old and trusted Indian brand. And such great value for money.The fragrance is nice powdery scent which is refreshing without being overpowering. The soap’s cleansing is good, not great. But it has a nice creaminess which is far beyond its modest price. In fact, it has a nice natural creaminess, and not the slipperiness of a Dove. Also, it seems to long last. A clear winner and will be a regular feature on my bathing rack.\n",
      " I liked the quality of the soap as it wasn't getting too chunky even if it stays wet for most part of the day. BUT, the DEO fragrance in body after taking bath with this soap *** All those are just marketing GIMMICKS. It's got no great fragrance than other soaps and actually it's just too minimal. Anyhow the product feels like of good quality.\n",
      " I really had liked the packing of this soap. But more than that, I remember as soon as I had unpacked it, the surprising fresh smell coming from it was amazing.The soap foam feels soft, rich and white. It moisturizes the skin perfectly. I have an oily skin so I wanted a soap which can balance the skin moisture, not over moisturizing not drying out the skin. And this soap pretty much does that.Also, it lasts for a good time, also most soaps give up their foaming capability as soon as they become small, but this one still gives great lather. Would recommend to everyone.\n",
      " Nice smelling scented bath soap from Cinthol. The scent lingers for a while even after washing off and leaves the bathroom also smelling great. Besides that it does its job of cleaning as it should. So full points there. Only thing is I was somewhat misguided and ordered a smaller pack when I needed a larger one.\n",
      " Nice quality product. Great product. Buying all the product from Amazon Pantry regularly.Thank you Amazon for such great quality products at such an affordable rate.\n",
      " I thought the product might be black or charcoal colour but it's a regular white one. The scent is not that great and didn't feel any difference btw normal average soap and this one. I feel the lime one is better than this. Its just a good marketing and nothing else.\n",
      " I placed order 4+1 soaps.But I have received without seal pack with 4 No's soaps only. Now how can get remaining soap.\n",
      " The soap is ok for bathing, no scent at all, more drier. The green one from cinthol is much better.\n",

      " After blindly using this soap for *years* it suddenly struck me that there is zero cooling effect in this soap now and by now I mean 2-3 years.I started using cinthol cool 6-7 years ago as a kid when I used to think how awesome is this soap (with that tingling cooling after sensation) I felt that this soap is way underrated because of that and the signature smell of it. But now I have realised that the cooling part is ZERO. And the fragrance is bland and doesn't last long.Either this soap is fake because I've been continuously ordering this soap online in saver pack of 4/5 soaps from Amazon (but the seller being a trusty one at that 🤔) or Godrej has changed the chemical composition of this soap.Either Godrej should bring a \"stronger\" version of cinthol cool soap or I should look for better alternatives because this soap isn't what it used to be once.\n",
      " I bought this product because I was experiencing some bad prickly heat and thought the menthol would help. Although I don't feel the 'minty' feeling I was hoping for, I am still well pleased. The scent is very nice and refreshing but not over-bearing like it should only be used by MALES, not medicinal smelling. I don't feel as though my skin is dry and cracking off. And the prickly heat symptoms are gone. I like this product, I will be suggesting it to my friends and family.\n",
      " ONE OF THE WORST PRODUCTS WHICH I RECEIVED. THIS CINTHOL BATH COOL SOAP HAS NO FRAGRANCE, NO COOL EFFECTS AT ALL. SHOULD NOT PURCHASED BY ANYBODY. THE PACKET IS SHOWING THE DATE IS 01.2020. BUT I THINK IT MUCH MUCH OLDER DUE TO IT'S NO FRAGRANCE. I CANNOT RETURN IT BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO USE ONE OF THIS.\n",
      " In television advertisement, the color of the soap is shown as transparent as glass.But when I bought it, the color of the soap was in blue shade.I had to buy around 5 soaps.This is totally a cheating experience by the manufacturer.Did not expect such a fraud experience.\n",
      " Decent Soap. Very fresh and nice. Gives good amount of lather. But not the best flavor of Cinthol according to me. I like other flavors better. Cinthol is my fav soap. 😊\n",
      " Has absolutely no perfume at all... and it is blue in colour not transparent from as it is shown in Cinthol Ad.Total waste\n",
      " This soap fluxes so fast even when you put it in a separate soap case and when you apply that melted soap, some part of it is stuck on your body specially on chest region and if you have large chest hair it will trouble you later.\n",
      " I have ordered 4+1=5 pcs cinthol soapBut I have received only 4 pcs Shop1 pcs shop is missing in my order\n",
      " Verry good\n",
      " My wife likes it. She has been using this brand of soap for years. Not much else to say. It’s a bar of soap.\n",

      " Someone like me had always fancied upon getting some of my hair getting coloured when I see some people with colored or highlighted hair.Going to parlor or salon has always been hard on budget if you are living in a working middle class family.Finally I decided to get 2 packets of this hair highlighter after doing some research and surfing various Youtube videos.Coming to this product let me review as under:Pros:1  Gives good color/highlights if kept for about 45 minutes. (note: 30 minutes is not enough if you have dark black hair).2 The color stays for about 8-9 months and lightens with time.3 After about 1-1.5 months of applying this hair color, I would suggest to use henna/mehendi for about 1 hour in all you hairs...which will not only nourish your hair, but also give very good result for highlighted hairs.4 Personal tip- If you are not satisfied with colored/highlighted hair and want to remove it, use anti-dandruff shampoo 3-4 times while washing your hair. Also the Godrej hair dye (black) available in powder sachet is also effective in removing the highlights.Cons:1 One sachet is not enough even for short hair. Purchase 2 sachets if you want proper results. (note: if you are a girl with shoulder length hair or more, I would suggest 3 sachets).2 Does not give too much highlighted effect if you want to get noticed from others with normal hair.3 Just like any other chemical hair color, it damages you hair and makes your hair rough.Verdict:It is ok to give this a try once if you want to color/highlight your hair at home. I would rather suggest spending few bucks and get your hair highlighted in parlor or salon for better results.If you find my review helpful, please click the YES/HELPFUL button! 👍\n",

It really does moisturize your skin. Perfect for dry skin, specially in harsh winter.I've very dry and sensitive skin so i need a very good moisturising  skin care routine specially in winter months. My sensitive skin does not agree with random products bought off the shelf. I tried this in 100ml tube as it's herbal and I liked as it really does moisturize my dry skin so I bought this 200ml pack from Amazon.I removed a star though as it's outlet is so big ,a very generous amount plops out in single pump and you end up finishing it up way faster as compared to other face wash( the 100ml tube had a very generous outlet too).\n",

      " From Amazon they send my package very safely so it m happy with their services but this shampoo is not suitable for adults i ordered it for myself (btw i m 20) and u can't believe how horrible it's result is, actually i ordered it for decreasing my hair fall but using 1time my hair fall increase horribly and my hair became so sticky that i can't explain....i never use that shampoo after that it was just a waste of money\n",
      " Don't know if just our bottle was duplicate or not, as it was discounted and my son and daughter had instant hair loss. Threw it out and reverted to Johnson and the hair loss stopped after another 2 days. Will not use this again\n",
      " Great shampoo! Sulfate free, mild, soothing fragrance. Make sure you take a lot more than you usually do for it to feel sufficient. Also, rub your palms together to create a soft lather and then rub on to scalp/hair. This is important. Really useful to those with curly hair. Gentle enough for your little one.\n",
      " Very Nice Product . It is very light weighted and quickly gets absorbed so that you don't feel  creamy when you get out using this. It gives a smooth feeling to our skin and will not irritated your skin at all. This product is a lotion and not a moisturizer so it is not a replaced for that this is baby lotion too. It works very well for your skin.As this is not an oily lotion which will not make you sweat even in hot summer It  smells  good and leaves skin smooth afterwards.  Even though this is a baby lotion people with very sensitive skin can also use this one as it is good for damaged skin too. After using for many months i can say it rebuilds your skin.Himalaya is now not using Paraben for Baby lotion so the lotion is safe than before. This lotion is not greesy at all. Please go for Original product as duplicates are out there.\n",
      " I bought this for myself because it came up under a search for vegan lotion. However, I will continue buying it because it is so lightweight and quickly absorbed. I live in the desert and am impressed by how much it hydrates my skin.Thank you Amazon\n",
      " This is one of the best baby lotion in Market. I got this at Rs.67 only. As it is from Himalaya, I need not to write anything about quality as Himalaya products are always best in class.\n",
      " Best product for kids\n",
      " I've ordered it 3 times and likely to order again. Unlike the 400ml Himalaya gentle baby shampoo or gentle baby bath which has no seals, this lotion comes in clear laminated sealed pack and I've received it in good condition and packing all the 3 times I ordered. Although it's tad light it's okay for baby skin. I love it's fragrance, leaves my baby smelling nice and I use it myself too but it's too light for my dry skin,but of course it's meant mainly for babies.One winning feature about this particular 400ml pack is it's pump feature,makes it lot easier to literally use it singlehandedly which comes in real handy if you've to hold a squirming wriggling baby with your other hand!Update : I've ordered my 9th bottle! Initially seller give one bottle but nowadays the minimum quantity is 2 bottles. But it's okay,your baby is going to use it every day and they come with very good shelf life so you finish them long before it's expiry date.\n",

      " i bought this cream for my mom and ladies believe me its work great more then fancy costly  creams but yes its oily but thts ok bcs of result....i wish a serum in same series...thanx amazon ad himalaya..pls like yes if u love my review bcs its free for u.\n",
      " I was using Himalaya moisturized 8 years back and my skin was really good, soft and gentle. After I moved to Hyderabad I moved to different products like Olay, Ponds, Lotus, Maybelline, Lakme etc. I wasn't happy with any of them. but this Anti aging cream is awesome, in a weeks time I can see and feel the difference in my skin, its very light and light smell. Totally like this cream.\n",
      " I have ordered this product for my Mom. And she is very happy with the results after using this product.It does works nicely to reduce your wrinkles if you will apply it on daily bases.At least use this twice in a day, if you really want to improve your skin tone.What I liked the most about this product:#####################################👌Its fragrance is good.👌Made up with natural ingredients, So it won't harm to your skin.👌Comes with a very cheaper price if we will  compare to other related brands.👌JUST go for this product if you are suffering from wrinkle problem.####################################GO for it.Its a value for money product under budget.🤗\n",
      " I got this for my mom because of the reviews and, to be honest, because of its low price. My mom has been applying it with great dedication every night for over 2 months now (had it ordered 2 times). I can’t say I have seen much of a difference. The least a cream can do is moisturize, but this cream doesn’t work as a moisturizer either. Again, I might be wrong and because my mom has just started using aging creams while she should have started at least some 10 years ago. But, I would really recommend going with better options. And people in the same predicament as mine, can you please suggest me creams that might work?\n",
      " So nice product, my skin is combination type (oily n dry), it works magically especially in winter. Gives u Extra softness..\n",
      " My mom changed from ponds day n night cream  after ages and the result is so good.\n",
      " I was bit skeptical about this cream as I was not sure this is good for my age group or not. After using this for about a week I can say that this one is great cream for anyone who is 25+. It's very moisturising so if you have oily skin like I do, little is more. I love to mix it with few drops of rose water n massage my face for a min or so.\n",
      " I would like to give five stars. Really amazing work on wrinkles. I am using my third bottle. But apply it on wrinkles before going to sleep. Apply little thicker. You can see the amazing results. Those who are worried about their wrinkles go for it. I got it for 165rs.\n",
      " This product gives burning sensation, forget removal of wrinkles and ageing signs. I even got red pathes and rashes on face after 3 days of use. M a huge Himalaya fan, but this product is a big NO!!\n",
      " I love it! Light texture, light scent, excellent results. Keeps you looking youthful, of course won't do miracles, but will slow aging process and I feel it removed expression lines that were starting to show. I've been using it for quite a while, almost a year, and it's the best product I've tried of its kind. I can use makeup straight on top of it and it's fine.\n",
      " i bought this cream for my mom and ladies believe me its work great more then fancy costly  creams but yes its oily but thts ok bcs of result....i wish a serum in same series...thanx amazon ad himalaya..pls like yes if u love my review bcs its free for u.\n",
      " I was using Himalaya moisturized 8 years back and my skin was really good, soft and gentle. After I moved to Hyderabad I moved to different products like Olay, Ponds, Lotus, Maybelline, Lakme etc. I wasn't happy with any of them. but this Anti aging cream is awesome, in a weeks time I can see and feel the difference in my skin, its very light and light smell. Totally like this cream.\n",
      " I have ordered this product for my Mom. And she is very happy with the results after using this product.It does works nicely to reduce your wrinkles if you will apply it on daily bases.At least use this twice in a day, if you really want to improve your skin tone.What I liked the most about this product:#####################################👌Its fragrance is good.👌Made up with natural ingredients, So it won't harm to your skin.👌Comes with a very cheaper price if we will  compare to other related brands.👌JUST go for this product if you are suffering from wrinkle problem.####################################GO for it.Its a value for money product under budget.🤗\n",
      " I got this for my mom because of the reviews and, to be honest, because of its low price. My mom has been applying it with great dedication every night for over 2 months now (had it ordered 2 times). I can’t say I have seen much of a difference. The least a cream can do is moisturize, but this cream doesn’t work as a moisturizer either. Again, I might be wrong and because my mom has just started using aging creams while she should have started at least some 10 years ago. But, I would really recommend going with better options. And people in the same predicament as mine, can you please suggest me creams that might work?\n",
      " So nice product, my skin is combination type (oily n dry), it works magically especially in winter. Gives u Extra softness..\n",
      " My mom changed from ponds day n night cream  after ages and the result is so good.\n",
      " I was bit skeptical about this cream as I was not sure this is good for my age group or not. After using this for about a week I can say that this one is great cream for anyone who is 25+. It's very moisturising so if you have oily skin like I do, little is more. I love to mix it with few drops of rose water n massage my face for a min or so.\n",
      " I would like to give five stars. Really amazing work on wrinkles. I am using my third bottle. But apply it on wrinkles before going to sleep. Apply little thicker. You can see the amazing results. Those who are worried about their wrinkles go for it. I got it for 165rs.\n",
      " This product gives burning sensation, forget removal of wrinkles and ageing signs. I even got red pathes and rashes on face after 3 days of use. M a huge Himalaya fan, but this product is a big NO!!\n",

This tea when boiled in the water gives a nice flavor and the color which no other teas can give.The packaging was nice. I ordered for a 1kg pack directly since I already knew about the taste.From the value for money standpoint, it is a little costlier (20-30 Rs per kg)  in comparison to its other teas of its class. But you will find it worth it. Just make sure you use a correct method to prepare to get the best out of it.Method in the sense, first boil it in water and then add milk.Directly adding into milk will also give you the good taste but the colour will fade away in that case.\n",

      " Recently, I visited a relative in Dubai and tasted Society Masala tea for the 1st time.  I simply loved it, more so when I found real ingredients like cinnamon, cardamom, ginger etc. written on the box.  I ordered same tea in india once I got back and I am shocked to see that there are no real ingredients.  The box says there are added 'flovors' only.  How disgusting to find that what is sold in india and exported abroad is totally different.  I wish I could return the tea but unfortunately, Amazon does not accept return of food items.\n",

      " The original society tea the blue packet is better than this. It has one salty taste that make the tea horrible. No premium quality. Price has increased with deteriorated quality\n",
      " The tea is really good. Tastes better than wagh bakri premium tea but grain size is much smaller.Leaves a lot of dust at the bottom of the container which is a bit annoying. Every time you finish the container, a lot of tea will be wasted in the form of dust.\n",
      " We are drinking this tea since years when we are in Mumbai.Only recently started to purchase it on amazon as it is'nt available in any stores across Hyderabad.But in few packets the tea is very tiny n does not taste as strong as it should be.\n",
      " As the pricing was highest for this product in the company range assumed that it would be the best color and flavor.However was disspointed as the flavor is similar to the cheaper leaf tea or even some good dust variety. Also the tea leaves had some foul chemical odour coming, usually teas leaves give a fine frangance.This was prepared with full milk and not black. Not buying this again for sure.\n",
      " Great taste. Bought it for my parents as they prefer mild teas and it is great for both mild and strong teas. We add a bit more leaves to make it strong. Most teas in Kerala have a flowery taste and they are not good for masala chai. This purchase solved that issue. It's great as a black tea as well. Just don't boil it while making black tea. Boil the leaves only for masala chai.\n",

      " We are drinking this tea since years when we are in Mumbai.Only recently started to purchase it on amazon as it is'nt available in any stores across Hyderabad.But in few packets the tea is very tiny n does not taste as strong as it should be.\n",
      " As the pricing was highest for this product in the company range assumed that it would be the best color and flavor.However was disspointed as the flavor is similar to the cheaper leaf tea or even some good dust variety. Also the tea leaves had some foul chemical odour coming, usually teas leaves give a fine frangance.This was prepared with full milk and not black. Not buying this again for sure.\n",
      " Great taste. Bought it for my parents as they prefer mild teas and it is great for both mild and strong teas. We add a bit more leaves to make it strong. Most teas in Kerala have a flowery taste and they are not good for masala chai. This purchase solved that issue. It's great as a black tea as well. Just don't boil it while making black tea. Boil the leaves only for masala chai.\n",

      " If you really a teas fan, you definitely not being unaware of the TATA Tea family. Trusted brand from so many years. I tried almost every standard brand of Teas available in the market, but at last I can say that TATA Tea is the best available brand in the printed price. Although TATA Tea brand is already quite efficient in serving the purpose but the current addition of 'TATA Tea Gold' actually makes sense because of the quality enhancement by adding dried whole tea leaves in to the processed tea. Mixing of whole leaf resulted into the enhanced flavor & color of the prepared Tea. Not more concentrated not milder, it’s like a balanced golden color with real taste/flavor which designed exactly keeping in mind the expectation of the user.1. I agree that if you require strong color/flavor you need to add a little more leaves in to the preparation because TATA Tea Gold is not meant for people who like very strong color seekers. Its more workable for people who wants real flavor with natural golden color in the final preparation. Although even a single tea-spoon is enough to prepare a natural golden cup full of real tea.2. One may keep in mind before using that this tea contains real whole dry tea leaves, so it may take more 2 minutes in preparation in comparison with other brands and the reason is, it is without any added artificial colors into it. The whole dried tea leaves takes time to release real flavor of the contents.3. Taste is premium & up to the expectations as always.4. Packaging is good enough. Visual ergonomic principles well taken into consideration designing the same. Its smarter and visually appealing than the previous packs.I’m using this product from more than 2 years.

      " The product was delivered on time. It's definitely worth the price. Using this for the past 3 months and I have no complaints. Quality of the product is exceptional. It's a bit heavy and no negatives apart from that...\n",
      " I am writing review after 15 days use.Big dial as expected with great quality. Color of dial not too dark specially numbers as shown in photo. Bracelet is also very good. But the packing and container of watch is worst that i have ever seen in online shopping. sometime it stops working when it falls.By pushing the pin it starts working again.overall it is a very good watch. waterproofing  is also working properly.I bought it after 2 month search on amazon and flipkart and it makes worth.\n",
      " Watch seems original but the price paid is equal to showroom price and if u add courier charge is over and above the selling price in showroom. Better buy from showroom rather online since u will get ur product immediately and can able to check the condition there itself. Rest about product is good but the steel quality is Matt finish and not that great to hold. Dial is awesome and lil big in size to give rich look.\n",
      " Excellent quality and looking cool when I wear this, the white dial is awesome and I like it more. Orange needles for time indication gives good look to watch.\n",

      " 1. sleep mode not operating2. battery life not more than 1 day\n",
      " Good product 👍👍👍👍 as it is my second smart watch this is better than my previous one...\n",
      " I like this band giving almost accurate Heart rate will very Good battery life. Good AMOLED top with decent look ,Broad daylight reading may be improved & if audio can be integrated will give more exciting feel factor\n",
      " Pros -Looks goodIndian brandConsThe software is poor.The band and app get updated everyday for bug fixes, but the update never completes.Sleep tracker doesn't work properly - no auto sensor, it depends on manual time feeding for sleep, plus sleep data changes of band firmware update causes sudden change in connection.Call notification does not work. It worked for a couple of calls, but then stopped on its own.Though the sedentary reminder was switched off, the band keeps vibrating every 15 minutes for reminding, even while walking or doing work. It stops only in night mode or when active workout is on.\n",
      " The heart rate monitor shows as OFF on the tracker whereas visible in the phone.The same value should be visible in the tracker as well as shown in the picture\n",

      " Ordered 2 of these and Got 2 defective pieces.Frequent impairing from mobile, discrepancy in sleep / movement tracking and horrible interface.Just bought this product for my parents because they wanted a made in India product but guess what, this product is made in China too! Great work Fastrack (Titan)!Would have given it Zero Stars if I possibly could.\n",
      " I had my hopes high but today when I worked out for 45 minutes and the fitband showed that I had lost only 10calories, I decided to return it.... May be this device is only for step counts, and I work out more than walking.... Not good....\n",

      " I have to thank the amazon recommendation engine for suggesting the mysore sandal talc. I never knew mysore sandal brand had a talc!

The Fragrance is the first thing which hits you as soon as you open the bottle. Its smells pure authentic sandal wood than the perfumed ponds talc powder2. The mysore sandal talc allows you to decide the size of the hole you want to have on the bottle. Ponds one forces you to have 3 holes as soon as you want the top cover. I always hated this with the ponds talc. Ponds really wants you to use more than what you need!3. The fragrance last longer than the ponds sandalwood talc even though out the day! Believe it or not - you have to try one and be the judge!4. Some reviews talk about the powder not been finely powdered. Nothing like that - the powder is as fine as it's with Ponds sandalwood talc. No more no less!5. The bottle is sealed with a hologram sticker - that's assurance of genuine product from mysore sandal!6. Somehow I like the press-fit top of the bottle to keep the fragrance intact in the bottle when not in use! Ponds bottle was a twist to close top which is not really a seal tight way of shutting close the bottle7.

      " I bought this on a lark and it had been sitting on a shelf for a very long time. Till I developed warts on my chin. No amount of pulling and scrubbing helped and I was reluctant to use over-the-counter wart paint because of all the pharma warnings on them.I decided to use this clay on the warts, covering them with a generous coat of the clay twice a day and kept it on day and night for a month. Voila!I had to be patient but a month of application fixed my skin. Whatever this face pack contains, it is extremely effective. I used to a feel a constant sting after application but it can be ignored. The best part is that it didn't affect healthy skin adversely unlike wart paints which require precautions.Caution - These warts weren't because of an STD. I probably picked them up at the gym or some other place with too many people milling around in sweat. Please seek your doctor's advice if you have an STD.

      " I stay in Bangalore snd used this product on couple of occassion. Its amazing and stands well above any available soap in marketLooking at tje expwrience decided to gift ghe soap to a relative and the product that was delivered was a fake and just a lump of cake with so smell and offcourse no way close to the original soapRelative was shy enough to admit his / her experience late other wise could hav returned the productHppe Amazon takes some action\n",
      " It’s the worst thing you can buy. Do not waste your money. You will land up to a soap which will lead to dry skin after bath and you won’t feel like using it again.  Only using name like millennium soap doesn’t make it a soap of millennium. Buy products like nutregena or forest essential rather then buying this particular soap.\n",
      " Don't think this is original.The golden seal on inside plastic box seems to have been tampered with and resealed with plastic tape.\n",
      " The product is not original.. I just used one I got from store in Bangalore and this is no way close to the original product. The soap is soft and breaks in flakes... the original is not like this .. please don't buy would be my honest opinion.  Rest up to you.\n",
      " i always buy this soap cause it smells like strong sandal wood. when i was first introduced to the soap it was a guy coming out of the shower and i stopped him asking which parfum he uses and he pointed me to the soap. at first i couldnt believe it but now after so many years using it there is no doubt anymore.\n",
      " Something is wrong with this product currently, I've been using it since 3 years nd have loved it but the latest batches delivered to me seem fake.

Disappointed.. i miss the pure, older millennium soap\n",
